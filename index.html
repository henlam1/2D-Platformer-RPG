    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This document describes a game called "Shadow Knight", which is designed to be an adventure RPG, 
        2D side-scroller. The game will include basic techniques for 2D games such as tiled backgrounds, 
        collision detection, physics, AI, efficient memory management by using the Wolfie 2D engine.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
        The game will be developed as a TypeScript application using the
        <a href='https://github.com/WolfieEngine'>Wolfie2D</a> game engine. WebGL will be used as the underlying rendering technology.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The game is a mix of side-scroller and platformer in which the main objective of each level is to kill the enemies.

        Each level is split into two: a "training" area and the boss area which is required to reach the next level. In the training area,
        the player can kill enemies for rewards in the form of experience and skill points. This area is meant to be used as preparation for
        the boss fight. The boss area will contain puzzles that the player must solve in order to reach the boss.
        Once within the boss area, players can no longer change their loadout. Preparation should be made before entering the boss level.

        <br/><br/>
        
        The player will have the choice of selecting skills and upgrades immediately before the boss fight. Random modifiers and effects to the
        level may be applied to encourage different skill builds. Depending on the random modifier, some skills may be more effective for a
        particular level than others.
    </p>

    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>
        The game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Following are the keybindings:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Key</th>
                <th>Function</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>W</td>
                <td>Jump Up</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>Move Left</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>S</td>
                <td>Jump Down</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>D</td>
                <td>Move Right</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>U,I,O,P</td>
                <td>Use Skills (1-4)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>K</td>
                <td>Access Skill Book</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ESC</td>
                <td>Pause the game</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
