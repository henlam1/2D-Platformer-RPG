        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This document describes a game called "Shadow Knight", which is designed to be an adventure RPG, 
            2D side-scroller. The game will include basic techniques for 2D games such as tiled backgrounds, 
            collision detection, physics, AI, efficient memory management by using the Wolfie 2D engine.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
            The game will be developed as a TypeScript application using the
            <a href='https://github.com/WolfieEngine'>Wolfie2D</a> game engine. WebGL will be used as the underlying rendering technology.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Back Story</h2>
        <p>
            Our story follows the life of an aspiring knight who was drafted into a long lasting war against the demons.
            Our knight fought on the front lines but he was unfortunately too inexperienced. He died a valiant death... until a mysterious Lich encountered his dead body.
            The Lich did some stuff and experimented on the knight. When the knight woke up, he lost all resemblance of a human but he has magic shadow powers now.
            He ventures into the world in hopes of finding the Lich to regain his humanity.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The Shadow Knight's objective is to survive in an unknown land. With his newfound powers and a fragile body, he must eliminate enemies and escape to reach the Lich.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            The game is a mix of side-scroller and platformer in which the main objective of each level is to kill all enemies before proceeding to the next level.
    
            Each level is either a training level or a boss level. In the training levels,
            the player can kill enemies for rewards in the form of experience and skill points. These levels are meant to be used as preparation for
            the boss fight. The boss level will contain puzzles that the player must solve in order to reach the boss.
            Once within the boss area, players can no longer change their loadout. Preparation should be made before entering the boss level.
    
            <br/><br/>
            
            The player will have the choice of selecting skills and upgrades immediately before the boss fight. Random modifiers and effects to the
            level may be applied to encourage different skill builds. Depending on the random modifier, some skills may be more effective for a
            particular level than others.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>
            The game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Following are the keybindings:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th align="Left">Key</th>
                    <th align="Left">Function</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>W, Space</td>
                    <td>Jump Up</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>A</td>

                    <td>Dash</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>U,I,O,P</td>
                    <td>Use Skills (1-4)</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>K</td>
                    <td>Access Skill Book</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ESC</td>
                    <td>Pause the game</td>
                </tr>
